        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
           My name is Zach, and I'm currently pursuing the CPDM major here at Cincy State. 
           I graduated from University of Cincinnati with a bachelor's in Biology three
           years ago, and after seeing how important information technology 
           (especially databases) are to modern research, decided an education in
           computers would be helpful for my career goals. I currently work at the main
           library in downtown Cincinnati. In my spare time I enjoy gaming, drawing, and
           nature walks.
